Given two n point sets in general position in the plane, it is an open question as to whether compatible triangulations always exist between them.

[2009. Diwan, Ghosh, Goswami, Lingas. On joint triangulations of two sets of points in the plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1235)

The problem of joint triangulation of A and B has two variations depending upon whether
the bijection between points of A and B are fixed in advance. The problem, where the bijection
is not fixed in advance (see Figure 1(i)), has been studied by Aichholzer et al. [1]. In this paper,
we consider the other problem, where the bijection is fixed in advance (see Figure 1(ii)).

Let A = {a1, a2, . . . , an} and B = {b1, b2, . . . , bn} be two disjoint sets of points in the plane,
specified by their respective x and y coordinates. A line segment bibj is called the corresponding
line segment of the line segment aiaj and vice versa. Similarly, a triangle bibjbk is called the
corresponding triangle of aiajak and vice versa. Let T (A) and T (B) denote the set of all
triangulations of A and B. The problem of joint triangulation of A and B, as stated earlier, is
to find triangulations T(A) ∈ T (A) and T(B) ∈ T (B), if they exist, such that for each region
bounded by a triangle aiajak in T(A), the corresponding triangle bibjbk bounds a region in
T(B) (see Figure 1(ii)). The problem was posed in 1987 by Saalfeld [9], and since then, several
researchers have worked on this problem but the problem is still open.

2 Necessary conditions

Let CH(A) and CH(B) denote the boundary of convex hulls of A and B respectively. We state
the first necessary condition for the existence of a joint triangulation of A and B, which relates
the edges of CH(A) and CH(B),

Necessary condition 1: If there exists a joint triangulation of A and B, then aiaj is an edge
of CH(A) if and only if the corresponding edge bibj is an edge of CH(B).

...

Intuitively, if a triangle ijk is a component triangle in a joint triangulation, one of the
successors on each edge of ijk that is not a convex hull edge is also a component triangle in the
joint triangulation. Let S denote the maximal subset of triangles in SA and SB such that each
triangle ijk in S has at least one successor triangle in S, on the edges ij, jk and ki that are
not convex hull edges. Note that if a triangle ijk does not have a successor triangle on a non

4

convex hull edge, then ijk can not belong to S. We call triangles in S as legal triangles and S
is called the set of legal triangles. Now, we state the second necessary condition.

Necessary condition 2: If there exits a joint triangulation of A and B, then the set of legal
triangles S is not empty.

Let P = fp 1 ; : : : ; p n g and Q = fq 1 ; : : : ; q n g be two point sets lying in the interior of rectangles in the plane. We show how to construct a piecewise linear homeomorphism of size O(n 2 ) between the rectangles which maps p i to q i for each i. This bound is optimal in the worst case; i.e., there exist point sets for which any piecewise linear homeomorphism has sizeOmegaGamma n 2 ). Introduction A homeomorphism is a 1-1, onto, continuous map with continuous inverse. Problems of constructing homeomorphisms arise in cartography, animation and computational fluid dynamics. A cartographer may wish to merge two similar maps, perhaps slightly distorting one, so that common landmarks coincide. A computer animator may want to transform one shape into the another, while preserving certain features. An aeronautical engineer using computational fluid dynamics may need to map a mesh onto the region surrounding the wing of a plane. Each application places different requirement...
